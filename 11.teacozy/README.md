# Tea Cozy

This is my second hand-in assignment of the Codecademy Ready course. It displays HTML and CSS styling to create a webpage. We last learned how to use flex boxes to locate content on the webpage. I used this knowledge to create a header that is fixed in position and content that is positioned, wrapped, and organized by class. 

Please enjoy my webpage!
