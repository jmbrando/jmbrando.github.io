    <p>When you type the address of a website into your browser, the browser requests the website from its owner and renders it for you. The prefix http stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which refers to the protocol by which the HTML file from another server is transferred to your computer. In modern browsers, you donâ€™t usually need to type http because the browser includes it for you.</p>
